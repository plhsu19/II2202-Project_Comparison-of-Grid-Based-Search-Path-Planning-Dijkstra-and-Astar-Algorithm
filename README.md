## II2202 Project: Comparison of Grid Based Search Path Planning Dijkstra and A* Algorithm
 The purpose of this project is to implement a state-of-the-art hybrid planning algorithm (hybrid A*) that is widely used in auto-driving applications for path exploration. The performance and efficiency of the algorithm is evaluated and compared with a more traditional planning algorithm (hybrid Dijkstra) experimentally in order to examine the effect of heuristic in the context of hybrid systems for autonomous vehicle simulation.

 Run the simulation by executing following commands within hybrid_A*_and_Dijkstra directory:

```bash
# run the simulation
>>> python3 main.py
```

You may also supply additional flags as so:
```bash
# show a plot
python3 main.py -p
# print trajectory information
python3 main.py -v
```
