# II2202 Project: Comparison of Grid Based Search Path Planning Dijkstra and A* Algorithm
## Implement hybrid version of two popular path-planning algorithms Dijkstra & A* and compare their performance 

#### Disclaimer: This is a project extended from the lab assignment of "DD2410 Introduction to Robotics" offered by KTH.  The simualtion environments and plot modules are provided by and downloaded from course Github: https://github.com/cisprague/dubins.git

#### Run the simulation by executing following commands within hybrid_A*_and_Dijkstra directory:

```bash
>>> python3 main.py
Grade E: 6/6 cases passed.
Grade C: 6/6 cases passed.
```

You may also supply additional flags as so:
```bash
# show a plot
python3 main.py -p
# print trajectory information
python3 main.py -v
```
