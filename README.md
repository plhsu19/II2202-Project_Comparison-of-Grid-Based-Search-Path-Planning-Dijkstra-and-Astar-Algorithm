# II2202-Project_Comparison-of-Grid-Based-Search-Path-Planning-Dijkstra-and-Astar-Algorithm
Implement hybrid version of two popular path-planning algorithms and compare their performance 

#### run the simulation by executing following commands within hybrid_A*_and_Dijkstra directory:

```bash
>>> python3 main.py
Grade E: 6/6 cases passed.
Grade C: 6/6 cases passed.
```

You may also supply additional flags as so:
```bash
# show a plot
python3 main.py -p
# print trajectory information
python3 main.py -v
```
